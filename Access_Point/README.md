Access Point
============

This script makes your Raspberry Pi an **Access Point**.
With this, you can directly connect to your Pi without
any actual network.

This is **not an ad-hoc**, meaning you can connect any unrooted android phone or tablet to it effortlessly.

Enjoy high speed data-transfers with scp and creating data-displays which are that much more responsive.

## Materials

I have tested this script with this <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1030">wifi dongle</a> from Adafruit:
