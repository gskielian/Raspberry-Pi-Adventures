PI-Tornado-Server
=================

In order to push data in real time from the raspberry pi's access point, we need to set up something which could rreply aptly to http requests.

Enter Tornado -- python web-server with sockets.

It may even be able to interact directly with our Arduino for streaming polling data using pyserial.
